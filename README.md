AJAX is a discord moderation bot that also has an EDSM and INARA API connection so you can use it for Elite: Dangerous servers.

> As this project is under heavy development, I cannot offer support at this time.  However, please do report bugs or issues on my little project [here.](https://github.com/Worthy-Alpaca/AJAX/issues)


## What it can do

- AJAX has build in spam protection and can be used to multi-kick. It also has the ability to add/remove roles to multiple members at once. Furthermore it features a customizable rank system that allows users to show what they like to play/do.
- AJAX has a database at his back that allows you to customize the way it works on your server.
- Once you invite AJAX to your server it will set up a bot-setup channel that can be used to configure me, using the built in !setserver command. Once all has been configured  that channel will be deleted after 2 minutes. 
- The most important executive commands (kick, ban, mute, role) get logged in the reports channel that you set in the setup process.
- In the configurtion you also have the option to set a custom prefix. The default prefix is **!**.
- The help menu is customized to the permission of the user who calls it and features a multi page setup.

AJAX features four categories
> - fun
> - moderation
> - info
> - setup
